ActsAsTaggableOn Example
================

This is just a quick and dirty example of how to use acts_as_taggable_on plugin by mbleigh, since there's a problem with the tag_counts at the moment I figured I'd just write my own (basic) tag cloud system for it.

Install / Usage
================

May need to update to edge Rails (using Rails 2.3.1 as of this writing)
1. gem install rails --source http://gems.rubyonrails.org
2. setup database.yml as needed (look at config/database.yml.example if you need help)
3. rake db:create
4. rake db:migrate

If you would like some test data:
rake dummy_data
